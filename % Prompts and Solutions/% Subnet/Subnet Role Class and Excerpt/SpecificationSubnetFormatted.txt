# Subnet

A “Subnet” is derived from a “LogicalNetwork” according to AutomationML Whitepaper -
Communication. It is defined as follows.

## Table 4 – Definition Subnet

### Role class name: Subnet

### Description: The role class “Subnet” shall be used in order to represent storing and managing of
properties and functionality of networks.

### Parent Class: CommunicationRoleClassLib/LogicalNetwork

### Path for Element reference: AutomationProjectConfigurationRoleClassLib/Subnet

### Attributes:

“Name” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”):
The attribute “Name” defines the name of the
subnet.
Note: This attribute is modelled by the
standard attribute Name of the relevant CAEX
object.
This attribute is mandatory.

“Type” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”):
The attribute “Type” defines the identifier of
the type of the subnet. The value of the type
is defined in the bus specific specification.
This attribute is mandatory.

“CustomAttributes” (ListType)[0..n]; “AttributeName” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”):
The name of the CustomAttribute defines the
property name in the target system. The
value defines the value of this
CustomAttribute. The AttributeName is
mandatory if the attribute “CustomAttributes”
exists. The AttributeName shall be unique.
Mapping of several custom attributes with the
same name can only be made by making the
key unique by appending a counter like #1,
#2, #3. Custom Attributes can have simple or
complex data types. The description of
complex values can be found in 5.3.

### Interfaces “LogicalEndPoint”(RefBaseClassePath=”CommunicationInterfaceClassLib/LogicalEndPoint”):
This interface is used to link node elements
to a subnet. The direction of the link is
irrelevant. A Subnet has exactly one
LogicalEndpoint to connect the subnet to
Nodes.


Depending on the different communication systems and bus systems a Subnet may contain additional
attributes. These attributes and the bus specific parameters are described in separate bus
specifications. Please refer to these bus specifications for more information.
