# Device

A “Device” is derived from a “PhysicalDevice” according to AutomationML Whitepaper -
Communication. It is defined as follows.

## Table 5 – Definition Device

### Role class name: Device

### Description: The role class “Device” shall be used in order to represent a collection in which the
individual HW objects of a slave or rack, including the slave or rack HW item, are brought
together.

### Parent Class: CommunicationRoleClassLib/PhysicalDevice

### Path for Element reference: AutomationProjectConfigurationRoleClassLib/Device

### Attributes:

“Name” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”):
The attribute “Name” defines the name of the
device.
This attribute is mandatory.
Note: This attribute is modelled by the
standard attribute Name of the relevant CAEX
object.

“TypeIdentifier” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”); “TemplateIdentifier” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”):
The attribute “TypeIdentifier” defines the
family identifier of the device type.
This attribute is optional.
The attribute “TemplateIdentifier” references
the path of a template element, for instance a
library. The syntax is defined by the
corresponding target system element.
This attribute is optional.

“Manufacturer” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”):
The attribute “Manufacturer” defines the
manufacturer of the device. The name of the
manufacturer must be unambiguous and
unique assigned to the manufacturer.
This attribute is optional.

“Comment” (AttributeDataType=”xs:string”):
The attribute “Comment” defines a comment
for the device. The attribute “Comment”
follows the Best Practice Recommendation
Multilingual expressions in AutomationML.
This attribute is optional.


Note: The attribute “TypeIdentifier” has a prefix which describes the semantic of the following identifier
separated by “:” The following prefixes are allowed: “OrderNumber”, “GSD”, "System”, „CSP+“.In case
of a missing TypeIdentifier the importing tool shall apply a substitution strategy. It is not ensured that the
substitution strategy succeeds in all cases.

Examples:
TypeIdentifier = “GSD:SIEM8139.GSD/DAP”
TypeIdentifier = "System:Device.Generic”
TypeIdentifier = "System:Device.S7-1500”
TypeIdentifier = "System:Device.IQ-R”
TemplateIdentifier =
" GlobalLib://TemplateLibrary/Master copies/S7-1500/preconfigured/PLCs/s7-1518F”
